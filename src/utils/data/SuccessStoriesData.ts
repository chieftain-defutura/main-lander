      "I really love this place a lot. I spent all of my time here. This institute has opened the door to many students here , including me. It was a wonderful journey with my mentors and friends, I had all the facilities I needed while preparing for the public examination. This place holds lots of memories. My ambition is to study aeronautical  engineering. Considering my ambition, I worked really hard with the support of the institute. Now I can proudly say I am an aeronautical engineering student. Atlast, I had one particular person who supported and guided me in many ways was our director mr. Esakki Muthu. His motivating and whispering  words pushed me to work hard and with that hard work I secured 554 marks in my 12th public exam. Thank you dehustle institute for the support. ",
